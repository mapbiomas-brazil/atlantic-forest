# About
This folder contains the scripts to classify and post-process the Atlantic Forest Biome.

We recommend that you read the Atlantic Forest Biome Appendix of the Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD).
[Link to ATBD](https://LINKLINK)

# How to use
First, you need to copy these scripts (including those in p04 folder) to your Google Earth Engine (GEE) account.

# Pre-processing
Step01: build stable pixels from Colleciton 4.1 and save a new asset. 
Step02: calculate area proportion for each class to each region that will be used to generate training samples
Step03: export balanced training samples for each region
Step04: export training samples for each year

# Classification
Step04a: export classification for each region

# Post-processing
Step05: merge classification of each region and apply Gap fill filter to remove NODATA
Step06a: create asset with 10 an 12 changes in classification
Step06b: apply incident filter to remove pixels with 10 an 12 changes from forest class
Step07: apply temporal filter
Step08: apply spatial filter
Step09: apply frequency filter
